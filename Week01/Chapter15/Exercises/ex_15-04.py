# The equation of a straight line is “y = ax + b”, (or perhaps “y = mx + c”). The coefficients a and b completely describe the line. Write a method in the Point class so that if a point instance is given another point, it will compute the equation of the straight line joining the two points. It must return the two coefficients as a tuple of two values. For example,

# >>> print(Point(4, 11).get_line_to(Point(6, 15)))
# >>> (2, 3)

# This tells us that the equation of the line joining the two points is “y = 2x + 3”. When will this method fail?
