# Give the logical opposites of these conditions
#         a > b
#         a >= b
#         a >= 18  and  day == 3
#         a >= 18  and  day != 3

a > b  opposites a <= b
a >= b  opposites a < b
a >= 18  and  day == 3  opposites a < 18  or  day != 3
a >= 18  and  day != 3  opposites a < 18  or  day == 3
